In today's digital age, the need for software protection is crucial more than ever. With cyber
attacks becoming increasingly sophisticated and pervasive, obfuscation and other forms of
software protection are of interest not only to legitimate software developers seeking to
safeguard their code and intellectual property, but also to malware writers seeking to create
new viruses able to evade antivirus detection and to attackers in general, with the goal to
steal sensitive information, compromise code integrity, or insert backdoors into targeted
systems. Software protection is a complex and interdisciplinary field that intersects with
many different fields such as cryptography, networks, computer architecture, operating
systems, programming languages and compilers. The _Workshop on Attacks and Software
Protection_ (_WASP_) will provide a meeting point dedicated to exploring and advancing the
latest research and techniques in software attacks, analysis and protection both from the
offensive and the defensive perspective. WASP will focus on new models and techniques to
defend software from tampering, reverse engineering, and piracy, as well as the
development of new analysis techniques and new attack strategies that highlight the need
for more complete defenses.

## Submission Details
{: style="text-align: justify"}
All accepted papers will be published in the Springer [LNCS series](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs). Extended versions of selected paper will also be invited to a Special Issue (more info will be published soon).

{: style="text-align: justify"}
Submitted papers must not substantially overlap with previously published or currently under
review papers for journals or conferences.
The only accepted format for submission is pdf.
All submissions must be written in English and follow the LNCS template available [here](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines), with a maximum length of 14 pages excluding appendices
and bibliography, and 16 pages total.
Appendices should be well-marked, but it's not mandatory for the committee to review them.
The review process is single-blind.
Failure to comply with these guidelines may lead to rejection without considering the
content's quality. If accepted, authors must agree to the Springer LNCS copyright and
present their papers at the workshop.
